# Predicting-Temperature-in-London
Using historical weather data and predictive modeling techniques, we aim to forecast the temperature in London.

As the climate changes, predicting the weather becomes ever more important for businesses. Since the weather depends on a lot of different factors, you will want to run a lot of experiments to determine what the best approach is to predict the weather. In this project, you will run experiments for different regression models predicting the mean temperature, using a combination of sklearn and MLflow.
